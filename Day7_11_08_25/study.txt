How to tokenize and parse the command and parameters.
Tokenizing = breaking a string into smaller pieces (“tokens”) based on delimiters (spaces, commas, tabs, etc.).

In our FTP example:

Command = First token (USER)

Parameter(s) = Remaining token(s) (admin)

2️⃣ Tokenizing with strtok()
strtok is the easiest built-in C function for tokenizing strings.

Steps:

Copy input string into a modifiable buffer (because strtok changes it).

Call strtok(buffer, " \t") to get the first token (command).

Call strtok(NULL, " \t") repeatedly to get the rest (parameters).

💡 Tokenizing does not care what those tokens mean — it only separates them.

Parse = 
An FTP command parser simply means:

A piece of code that reads FTP commands sent by a client (like USER, PASS, PWD, QUIT, etc.),
understands what the command is,
and extracts any parameters (like a username, file path, IP address).

📌 In context of FTP
When you connect to an FTP server, you send commands in plain text:
| Example Command         | Meaning                                 | Parameter           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `USER admin`            | Set username to `admin`                 | `admin`             |
| `PASS 1234`             | Set password to `1234`                  | `1234`              |
| `PWD`                   | Print working directory                 | *(none)*            |
| `CWD /folder/subfolder` | Change directory to `/folder/subfolder` | `/folder/subfolder` |
| `PORT 192,168,0,1,21,5` | Tell server which IP/port to connect to | `192,168,0,1,21,5`  |

Parsing = 
Definition: Taking the tokens and understanding their meaning based on rules (grammar or protocol).

Goal: Convert raw tokens into structured data that the program can use.

Output: Structured representation, like:

🛠 Why parsing is needed
FTP commands are text-based and can have different formats.

A parser turns the raw string into structured data the program can use.

3️⃣ Analogy
Think of tokenizing as cutting a sentence into words,
and parsing as understanding the grammar of the sentence.

📌 Example in English:
Sentence: "Open the door"

Tokenizing → ["Open", "the", "door"]

Parsing → Verb = "Open", Object = "door"
